5. How is the verifiability of block chain is been attained?

As a main feature of blockchain, there is an unique fingerprint for any data | also even if data is is altered even by one bit , the fingerprint of that data will get changed 
Secondle, exactly same data is stored atv different location plus multiple times , making varification of data much easier.
